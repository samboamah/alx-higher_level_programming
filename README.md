# Higher-level programming - Python
Module of **High-level programming** and **Python**, carried out during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **[ALX AFRICA](https://www.alxafrica.com/)**.

## Technologies
* Shell Scripts are written in Bash 5.1.16(1)
* Python Scripts are written and tested with Python 3.10.4
* `MySQL 5.7` (version 5.7.8-rc)
* `MySQLdb`, version 1.3.10
* `sqlalchemy`, version 1.2.5
* Tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
